## User Experience 




* Users are able to scroll through randomly generated pictures, gifs and sayings to brighten their mood and get a laugh.

* Users are then able to favorite pictures, gifs or sayings that they like which will then be displayed on a favorites page they can view them at any time!

* The Gif, Images and Saying pages are using API calls to display randomly generated content for the user to view.

* When the user clicks on the favorite button , the images and API urls are saved to local storage. The Favorites page then pulls the saved images and gifs from local storage and       appends it to the html for the user to view. 

* On the homepage we have a navbar so the user can click on either the images, gifs, sayings or favorites pages which will then take them to the designated page. Three MBD carasoules are on the homepage with random pictures from each catergory to give the user some samples of the content available.
